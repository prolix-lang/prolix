A versatile programming language with **simplicity**, **elegance** and **optimization**.

https://prolix-lang.github.io/

## Introduction
Prolix is ​​a general-purpose programming language and has a simple interface system along with many special features and support for many different fields. With Prolix syntax, it never touches commas and runs operators through functions instead of interpreting to solve a problem. Prolix here is aiming to simplify the process of writing and maintaining code while maximizing performance.

**Fast and Interoperable**
- Prolix provides high performance and interoperability with Java, allowing developers to seamlessly integrate code from Java.
- Developers can leverage existing libraries and code bases while benefiting from Prolix's simplicity and efficiency.
- With a focus on speed and efficiency, Prolix allows developers to code fast (or maybe not) and efficiently with ease.

**Simple and easy to use**
- Prolix has a clear and intuitive syntax, making it easy for developers to write and understand code.
- The language prioritizes simplicity and readability, ensuring that developers can quickly grasp its concepts and write maintainable code.

**Rich Feature Set**
- Prolix provides a rich set of features including variables, functions, control flows, data types, classes, and more.
- Support for advanced language constructs such as generics, inheritance, and operator overloading is planned, further enhancing Prolix's flexibility.
- The language aims to strike a balance between power and simplicity (sort of), giving developers the tools they need without unnecessary complexity.
